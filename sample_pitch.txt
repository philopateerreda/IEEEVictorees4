### **The Perfect Pitch: SynthMed (Short Version)**

"Every year, in-hospital medication errors harm hundreds of thousands of patients and cost the US healthcare system over $20 billion. This isn't a people problem; it's a data problem. Pharmacists are forced to manually verify complex orders against fragmented systems, leading to burnout and dangerous mistakes.

We are SynthMed, an AI co-pilot for hospital pharmacists. Our platform doesn't just check boxes; it understands the full patient context. In our first hospital deployment, we **reduced medication verification time by 90%** and **cut potential adverse drug events by over 92%**.

Our technology is our moat. Unlike static, rules-based systems from EHR incumbents, our proprietary AI achieves **98% accuracy** in identifying complex drug interactions, creating a powerful **data network effect** that gets smarter with every hospital we add.

Our market is a **$12 billion opportunity**, and our go-to-market is focused: we're targeting a winnable **$350 million beachhead** of mid-sized hospitals. And it's working. Our first paid pilot has already converted into a **$1.1 million multi-year contract**, and we have a qualified pipeline of over **$18 million in ARR**.

Our team was built for this. Iâ€™m a 15-year clinical pharmacist, and my co-founder was a lead AI engineer at Google Health. We have deep, first-hand experience in both the problem and the technology.

We are raising a **$3 million seed round** to scale our sales team and sign our next 10 enterprise customers. This capital will get us to $12M in ARR and solidify our position as the new standard for intelligent patient safety.

Thank you."
